# Frequency Counter Pattern
* Two separate loops are always better than two nested loops
* Two separate loops are O(2N) -> O(N), whereas two nested loops would be O(N^2)

## Task
Given two strings, write a function to determine 
if the second string is an anagram of the first.
An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging 
the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.<br>

Inputs are lowercase single words (strings).
No spaces, punctuation, numbers etc.
