# Multiple Pointers
Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning,end or middle based on a certain condition.<br>

Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

## Task
Implement a function called countUniqueValues, which
accepts a sorted array and counts the unique values
in the array. There can be negative numbers in the array,
but it will always be sorted.
